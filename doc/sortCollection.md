# Sort Collection Documentation

## Description

**Author**: Josh Kim

**Date Created**: 11/10/2021

**Date Modified**: N/A

**Purpose**: 

* This script sorts r/khiphop collections chronologically so that all the posts are ordered from oldest at the top to newest at the bottom. 

* Currently, the only way to reorder collections is to manually click and drag posts. This is very time consuming especially when the collection can hold a max of 100 posts.

* This script can be configured to work on other subreddits and collections. See code in src/sortCollection.py for more information.
