# Sort All Collections Documentation

## Description

**Author**: Josh Kim

**Date Created**: 11/10/2021

**Date Modified**: N/A

**Purpose**: 

* This script builds on top of the sortSingleCollection script. Instead of a specific collection, all collections are sorted chronologically with the oldest at the top and the newest at the bottom. This works regardless of layout type (Standard or Gallery).

* Currently, the only way to reorder a collection let alone a subreddit's entire collections is to manually click and drag posts. This is very time consuming especially when a collection can hold up to 100 posts.

* This script can be configured to work in other subreddits and for other collections. 

## Instructions

* See code in ../src/sortAllCollections.py for more information.
